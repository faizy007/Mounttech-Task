          <div class="accordion-header">How should I care for my Material knives?</div>
          <div class="accordion-content">Washing: Hand-washing your knives with a non-abrasive sponge is the way to go.
            Steer clear of the dishwasher to prevent damage to the blade and handle. Sharpening: We recommend an
            easy-to-use knife sharpener or if your knife needs an extra bit of TLC, a yearly professional sharpening. We
            also recommend honing your knife after 4-5 heavy duty uses, or as soon as you find yourself struggling to
            cut through a tomato with ease.</div>

          <div class="accordion-content">Our knives are made from three layers of Japanese stainless steel. The outer
            two layers are corrosion-resistant steel that make the knives easy to care for (no need to wipe down
            immediately), and the inner layer is a high-carbon steel that provides superior durability and strength for
            excellent cutting performance. Our knives have a Rockwell hardness of 59 ± 1, are ice-tempered to increase
